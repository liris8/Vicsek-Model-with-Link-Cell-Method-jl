# Vicsek Model Simulation in Julia

## Abstract
This repository is dedicated to simulating the Vicsek model, a computational model in statistical physics for simulating the collective behavior of self-propelled particles. The simulation uses Julia and incorporates the link cell method for efficiency. It is designed to replicate the results of the original Vicsek paper.

## Features
- **Link Cell Method**: Optimized for performance in simulating large systems of particles.
- **Main Vicsek Model Functions**: Functions for initializing the system, running the simulation, and analyzing the order parameter.
- **Order Parameter Analysis**: Tools for analyzing the collective behavior of particles under different noise levels.
